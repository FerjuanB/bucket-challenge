# Bucket challenge for Chicks Gold Developer Vacancy.

This UI was made in react, typescript and vite. and has a test in the custom hook created. 

I've created an UI to do the bucket challenge that permit to fill 3 simple inputs:

x jug: the quantity of gallons for first bucket
y jug: the quantity of gallonf for second bucket
z jug: the result that you want to achieve. 

UI Development: If this result in z jar is possible, the UI will tell you what instructions to follow to get the result by just filling, transferring between jars or emptying at each step, until you get the desired result that was entered at first.
